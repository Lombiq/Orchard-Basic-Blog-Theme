# Basic Blog Theme for Orchard CMS

Simple and clean blog theme for Orchard CMS created by MÃ¡rk Bartha. 

This theme is using the [Pretty Good Orchard Base Theme](https://github.com/Lombiq/Pretty-Good-Bootstrap-Base-Theme) as base theme which was created by [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com).

## Some notes about the theme

* The theme uses some fields as placeholders to display various contents like social sharing icons.
* This theme doesn't support multi-level menu yet.
* Some zones have been removed from the layout which are the following: `AsideFirst`, `TripelFirst`, `TripelSecond`, `TripelThird`, `FooterQuadFirst`, `FooterQuadSecond`, `FooterQuadThird`, `FooterQuadFourth`.
* Branding shape is not displayed. A widget must be used for branding.
* Widgets in the Navigation zone (possibly the MenuWidgets) are pulled right except the first one which is pulled left.
* HTML menu items with images are supported (ie. styled) in the Navigation zone.
* Featured zone has a background with the primary color.
* Blog post content item summary display shape has been overriden to be able to display the feature image.
* User shape containing the log in link or the user name is also hidden.

## How to use some of the features

### Adding featured images to blog posts

1. Create a `FeaturedImagePart` on the Orchard Dashboard.
2. Add a `MediaLibraryPickerField` to this part and give `FeaturedImage` as a name.
3. Attach this part on the `BlogPost` content type or any content type you'd like.

### Adding social content sharing icons

1. Create a `SocialPart` on the Orchard Dashboard.
2. Add an `InputField` to this part and give `ContentSharing` as a name.
3. Attach this part on any content type.

Furthermore, you can add the `Shape__ContentSharing` shape anywhere on the site (e.g. shape element on a layout) to display the same icons making it possible to share that page.

### Display summaries with only the title and published date

You need to use the `TitleSummary` display type. Here's one example on how to achieve that.

1. Go to the Queries page on the Orchard Dashboard.
2. Create a Query and add the filters you want. Add a new layout with an unordered list and set `TitleSummary` to the display type field.
3. Go to the Widgets page and create a Projection Widget in the AsideSecond zone.
4. Select the query with the newly created layout and save the widget.

### Adding social icons to the menu

HTML menu items are styled and can be used to display various images like social icons. 

1. Go to the Navigation page on the Dashboard.
2. Create a new Menu and add the HTML menu items with the icons.
3. Go to the Widgets page and create a MenuWidget after the main menu.
